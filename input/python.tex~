\hspace{-1.5em} Python is a dynamic language, as in python coding is very easy and also it require less coding and about its interpreted nature it is just excellent. Python is a high level programming language and Django which is a web development framework is written in python language. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X. Python is free to use, even for commercial products.Python can also be used as an extension language for existing modules and applications that need a programmable interface. Python is free to use, even for commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license.\\
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl, and Tcl. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Python is intended to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, frequently using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Similar to other scripting languages, Python programmers are usually more productive than 
C, C++ and Java programmers.\\
Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks; a feature also termed the off-side rule. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation 
signifies the end of the current block.\\\\
